          <p class="body-2">Thank you for your interest in Mohamed Ali Al Swailam Co.<br>‍<br>(MASCO)MASCO had been in existence for 50 long years; ever since 1970. It witnessed many triumphs and downturns too. Operating in one of the most complicated regions of the world whether politically, socially or financially. This engraved our strengths as a fierce competitor and unbreakable performer. Along time, MASCO stood while many of comparable size players faded away.<br><br>We attribute this resilience to our people. Each and every member ever worked with MASCO immediately becomes one of the family forever.
